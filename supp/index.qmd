>“The question of questions for mankind—the problem which underlies all others, and is more deeply interesting than any other—is the ascertainment of the place which man occupies in nature, and of his relation to the universe of things.” **–H. Thomas Henry Huxley**, _Man’s Place in Nature_

# Basis of inquiry

The Caddo division of labor suggests that---generally---men were the manufacturers of lithic tools and arrow points; which garners support from the ethnographic literature. 

If the material/s contained in each burial (individual; not group) were _personal property_ and not _offerings_—also supported by the ethnographic literature—then the null hypothesis (H0) would be that males adopted the knapping traditions/idiosyncrasies of their new community, while another (H1) would be that males retained the knapping traditions/idiosyncrasies associated with their natal community. 

Support for the null hypothesis is expected in instances where arrow points from individual burials within a community are largely homogenous; alternatively, the inverse would provide support for H1.

## Acknowledgments

I extend my gratitude to the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma, the Caddo Nation Tribal Council, Tribal Chairman, and Tribal Historic Preservation Office for their continued guidance and support of our work, as well as access to NAGPRA and previously repatriated collections. Thanks also to the Anthropology and Archaeology Laboratory at Stephen F. Austin State University for the requisite permissions and access to the NAGPRA objects from the Turner collections. I extend my gratitude to Emma Sherratt, Kersten Bergstrom, Lauren Butaric, Julien Claude, Dean C. Adams, and Michael L. Collyer for their constructive criticisms and suggestions throughout the development of this research program. Additional comments from the editor and three anonymous reviewers aided in further refining the manuscript.

## Funding

Components of the analytical workflow were developed and funded by a Preservation Technology and Training grant (P14AP00138) to RZS from the National Center for Preservation Technology and Training, as well as grants to RZS from the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma, National Forests and Grasslands in Texas (15-PA-11081300-033) and the United States Forest Service (20-PA-11081300-074). Additional funding and logistical support was provided by the Heritage Research Center at Stephen F. Austin State University.

## Data management

All data and analysis code associated with this project are openly available through the [GitHub](https://github.com/seldenlab/exogamy.1) repository, which is digitally curated on the Open Science Framework ([DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/PF5RQ](https://osf.io/pf5rq/)). Images of all Perdiz arrow points used in this study are openly available to view/download in an open access comparative collection ([https://scholarworks.sfasu.edu/ita-perdiz/](https://scholarworks.sfasu.edu/ita-perdiz/)), with permission from the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma. These supplementary materials include all analysis data and code used in the study, providing a means for others to reproduce (exactly) those results discussed and expounded upon in this article. The replicable nature of this undertaking provides others with the means to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components of this study [@RN20915;@RN20916;@RN20917], which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge. 

Reproducibility projects in [psychology](https://osf.io/ezcuj/) and [cancer biology](https://www.cos.io/rpcb) are impacting current research practices across all domains. Examples of reproducible research are becoming more abundant in archaeology [@RN20804;@RN21009;@RN8322;@RN8980;@RN11097], and the next generation of archaeologists are learning those tools and methods needed to reproduce and/or replicate research results [@RN21007]. Reproducible and replicable research work flows are often employed at the highest levels of humanities-based inquiries to mitigate concern or doubt regarding proper execution, and is of particular import should the results have—explicitly or implicitly—a major impact on scientific progress [@RN21008].
